#Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.
# Python divides the operators in the following groups:
# Arithmetic operators.
#Assignment operators.
#Comparison operators.
#Logical operators.
#Identity operators.
#Membership operators.
#Bitwise operators.


#Python Arithmetic Operators: Arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common mathematical operations.
x=4
y=2
g=x*y
# print( x * y)#8
j="x*y ={} "
print(j.format(g))

a=7
b=4
g=a//b
print("a//b = {}".format(g))#1


#Python Assignment Operators
#Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.

x=6
x+=4
print(x)#10
x=2
x *=11
print(x) #22



# Python Comparison Operators :Comparison operators are used to compare two values.
c=4
d=1
print(c!=d)#true
print(c<d) #false
